The sample dashboards use data in the SAMPLES catalog, which is separate from data within your workspace. The SAMPLES catalog is available to every workspace, but is read-only.

- You can schedule the dashboard to automatically refresh at an interval.
- At the top of the page, click Schedule.
- If the dashboard already has a schedule, you see Scheduled instead of Schedule.
- Select an interval, such as Every 1 hour.
- You can click Advanced to create a more complex interval, such as every 5 years.
- Select a SQL endpoint. A SQL endpoint is a compute resource that is specific to Databricks SQL. The SQL endpoint runs the dashboardâ€™s queries and generates the visualizations when the dashboard is refreshed. Select Starter endpoint, which is created automatically on each workspace.
- Admin users can create, configure, and delete SQL endpoints.
- Optionally, subscribe workspace users or alert destinations to receive an email version of the dashboard when it is automatically refreshed.
- Admin users can create, configure, and delete alert destinations. The email addresses of workspace users are automatically added as alert destinations.
- Click Save.
- The dashboard will be refreshed according to the schedule.
- To stop automatically refreshing a dashboard:
    - Click Scheduled.
    - Set Refresh to Never.
    - Click Save.
